# Angular with Java Services Free Online


## AFK Story

I had created [REST Web Services](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service) on [OpenShift](https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox) using [Spring Boot](https://start.spring.io/) [Java](https://www.java.com) [JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa) [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org)([MySQL](https://www.mysql.com)), and they were tested and deployed. OpenShift allows many types of deployments, including Node, but I couldn't figure out how to deploy an [Angular](https://angular.io) site on OpenShift, so I decided to deploy my Angular website on [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com). After struggling with deploying to bth sites for a a month, I had gotten the site running with just an error when calling the wrong REST endpoint. I fixed the endpoint and had no errors, when my son was pulling me [AFK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFK) to go to [McDonalds](https://www.mcdonalds.com). I wanted to figure out this problem, but I could only do it while AFK. I had known that the Angular site worked, the REST services worked, but the data wasn't showing up on the Angular web page. By the time I arrived at McDonalds, I had already narrowed the problem down to a [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html) View issue. I knew this because of the [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) paradigm: if the Model was broken between the Angular site and the REST services, then I would have seen an error; if the controller wasn't working, then I wouldn't have seen REST errors previously, so it had to be a data-to-HTML issue, which was quickly fixed when I returned home.

I had originally started with [CloudBees](https://www.cloudbees.com) when it was free, then migrated to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) which recently became unfree, and wanted to switch to OpenShift but had to also switch to FireBase for Angular programming.  Firebase does not host free Java websites.

I tried [000webhost](https://www.000webhost.com), which also didn't host Java websites for free.

I have programmed for over 40 years, started with Java 1.0, and recently learned Angular on the job. So I knew how to setup Angular-to-JavaREST website, but not how to host it on OpenShift or FireBase, so I went about [Google](https://www.google.com)-ing for examples of how to deploy.

There's _tons_ of IBM RedHat OpenShift and Google FireBase documentation and user sites on [GitHub](https://github.com) and elsewhere online.

After a month I figured out how to **deploy to OpenShift without any programming or YAML, JSON or Docker files**, mostly by using [this site](https://medium.com/fnplus/deploying-your-first-springboot-application-on-openshift-1dd5833aaab9).



* I created a project with a MariaDB by going to [OpenShift site](https://console-openshift-console.apps.sandbox.x8i5.p1.openshiftapps.com/catalog/ns/ftaylor92-dev?category=databases&keyword=maria), selecting +Add, selecting Database, and then selecting MariaDB
* Then I created the initial Spring-boot JPA MariaDB web services site without coding using [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io)
* (necessary only if using database) Then I changed spring.datasource.url, spring.datasource.username and spring.datasource.password in application.properties file in the downloaded code from Spring Initializer, and added my bookstore-specific code for REST endpoints.
* (unnecessary) I tested my code locally with mvn package spring-boot:run with a locally installed MariaDB
* (unnecessary) I also tested my OpenShift with a local installation of MiniShift, but MiniShift is v3 and OpenShift is v4.11 currently
* I pushed this code to a GitHub [repo](https://github.com/ftaylor92/springboot-webservice-simplest)
* Then I imported my GitHub repo into OpenShift by selecting +Add -> Import from Git -> https://github.com/ftaylor92/springboot-webservice-simplest -> (and these setting allow my website and webservices to be served via HTTPS, not HTTP) -> Show Advanced Routing Options -> TLS Termination: Edge, Insecure Traffic: None
* Then the site was up and running!
    * curl -i -X GET [https://springboot-webservice-simplest-git-ftaylor92-dev.apps.sandbox.x8i5.p1.openshiftapps.com/books](https://springboot-webservice-simplest-git-ftaylor92-dev.apps.sandbox.x8i5.p1.openshiftapps.com/books)
    * [https://springboot-webservice-simplest-git-ftaylor92-dev.apps.sandbox.x8i5.p1.openshiftapps.com/books](https://springboot-webservice-simplest-git-ftaylor92-dev.apps.sandbox.x8i5.p1.openshiftapps.com/books)

Spoiler alert: I had to deploy webservices to HTTPS because HTTP didnt work with Angular site on FireBase.

Then I had to **create and deploy my Angular site **to display data from my REST services

I started with [this code](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/codelab-kanban-fire/tree/improving-optimistic-updates), and then added HTML, Services and Component code and pushed it to a GitHub [repo](https://github.com/ftaylor92/angular-rest-firebase) (not node-modules/ folder or package-lock.json file), and followed the rest of the [tutorial](https://developers.google.com/codelabs/building-a-web-app-with-angular-and-firebase#9) to deploy my [webapp](https://kanbanfire-5712f.web.app).

There's still issues, like OpenShift Pods going to sleep and Angular sending OPTION instead of GET, but I feel good to have gotten this far.

My email is [fmtaylor92@gmail.com](mailto:fmtaylor92@gmail.com) is you have suggestions or need help, and my site is [http://fmt-drive.herokuapp.com/public-web-site/index.html](http://fmt-drive.herokuapp.com/public-web-site/index.html), which will change when Heroku finally goes down.
